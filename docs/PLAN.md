# Payments + Double-Entry Wallet Service — Project Plan

A production-grade payments backend with a double-entry ledger as the source of truth,
idempotent payment APIs, a hold→settle saga against a mock payment provider, async
settlement via signed webhooks, refunds/reversals, a reconciliation job, a transactional
outbox to Kafka, and full observability.

**Stack:** Java 21 (virtual threads) · Spring Boot 3.4 · PostgreSQL · Redis · Kafka · Docker · Micrometer/Prometheus/Grafana

> Companion docs: [HLD.md](HLD.md) (high-level design) · [LLD.md](LLD.md) (low-level design)

## 0. Best-practice decisions (researched, June 2026)

Validated against how Stripe, Modern Treasury, TigerBeetle, and the current Spring community build these systems:

- **Enable Java 21 virtual threads** (`spring.threads.virtual.enabled=true`). The hot path is dominated by a *blocking* PSP network call — the ideal virtual-thread workload (reported ~3x throughput, ~70% less memory on payment endpoints vs platform-thread pools). Caveats baked into the design: avoid `synchronized` around I/O (use `ReentrantLock`) to prevent carrier-thread *pinning*, set HikariCP `leak-detection-threshold`, and let the bounded DB pool be the real concurrency limiter.
- **Idempotency caches the first response whether it succeeded OR failed** (status + body) so retries replay even a 5xx identically — Stripe's exact behaviour. Keys are client-generated UUIDv4, ≤255 chars, pruned after 24h; follow the IETF `Idempotency-Key` header draft.
- **Balances are derived from immutable postings; the materialized balance row is a continuously-reconciled cache, not the source of truth** (Modern Treasury / TigerBeetle principle — a stored balance treated as authoritative will drift). Reconciliation asserts `balance == Σ postings` and global `Σdebits == Σcredits`.
- **The outbox gives at-least-once, not exactly-once.** Effective exactly-once = transactional outbox **+ idempotent consumers** (dedupe on event id). Start with a polling relay (simpler to build/debug/operate); migrate to Debezium CDC only if latency or DB load demands — the outbox table schema is identical either way.

Sources are listed at the bottom of this file.

## 1. Goals

- Demonstrate **exactly-once** payment processing via idempotency keys.
- A correct **double-entry ledger** with a non-negative-balance invariant under concurrency.
- A **saga** (lock → external call → settle) with compensating reversals.
- **Idempotent webhook** ingestion with HMAC signature verification.
- The **transactional outbox** pattern (atomic business-change + event publish).
- **Real measured numbers** (load test) and dashboards — not invented metrics.

## 2. Non-Goals (deliberately cut — knowing the boundary is a signal)

- Real bank/PSP rails, card networks, KYC/AML.
- Multi-currency FX conversion (one currency per account).
- Horizontal sharding of Postgres (single primary; document how you'd shard later).
- A UI. This is a backend/API project.

## 3. Money representation (decide once)

Store money as **`BIGINT` minor units** (paise/cents) + a `currency` column. Exact integer
arithmetic, no float/rounding bugs. (Contrast for interviews: crypto ledgers use `decimal(30,18)`
for 18-dp assets; fiat payments use minor-unit integers — be ready to explain the difference.)

## 4. Build milestones (~1 focused session each)

| M | Goal | Done when… |
|---|------|------------|
| **M0** | Skeleton | Docker Compose (Postgres + Redis + Kafka) up, Spring Boot boots, Flyway migrates, `/actuator/health` green |
| **M1** | Ledger core | Transfer primitive enforces double-entry sum=0 + non-negative; **concurrency test**: 100 parallel debits never oversell |
| **M2** | Payments + idempotency | Create payment, hold→settle saga vs in-process mock PSP; **test**: 50 parallel identical requests → exactly 1 payment |
| **M3** | Outbox + Kafka | Outbox poller (or Debezium CDC) publishes `payment.*` events; a consumer logs them |
| **M4** | Webhooks | HMAC-verified inbound webhook, idempotent on `psp_event_id`, async capture path |
| **M5** | Refunds + reconciliation | Refund reverses entries; reconciliation job resolves `FUNDS_LOCKED` and asserts Σdebits = Σcredits |
| **M6** | Observability + load test | Micrometer → Prometheus → Grafana; k6 load test → real p99 / RPS numbers; README + architecture diagram |

## 5. Testing strategy

- **Unit:** ledger invariants (sum=0, non-negative), state-machine transitions.
- **Integration:** Testcontainers for Postgres / Redis / Kafka.
- **Concurrency (the proof):**
  - 100 parallel debits on one wallet → balance never negative, no oversell.
  - 50 parallel identical `POST /payments` (same Idempotency-Key) → exactly one payment, one ledger transaction.
- **Idempotency replay:** repeat a completed request → identical cached response, no new side effects.

## 6. Observability (fixes the "no metrics" resume gap)

Instrument with Micrometer → Prometheus → Grafana:

- payment throughput & p99 latency
- idempotency-hit rate
- saga compensation (reversal) count
- **`ledger_imbalance` gauge that must always read 0** — alert if it ever isn't

Then run **k6** to capture a real "sustained _X_ payments/sec at p99 _Y_ ms" line for the resume.

## 7. Definition of done (resume-grade, not toy)

- [ ] README with an architecture diagram + a "Design decisions & trade-offs" section
- [ ] Runs end-to-end via `docker compose up`
- [ ] The two concurrency tests pass and are documented
- [ ] Real load-test numbers in the README
- [ ] Grafana dashboard screenshot committed

## 8. Interview talking points this unlocks

Exactly-once via idempotency keys · the dual-write problem and why the transactional outbox
solves it · double-entry + non-negative under concurrency · optimistic vs `SELECT … FOR UPDATE`
pessimistic locking (and why you never hold a DB lock across the PSP network call) · saga /
compensation · idempotent webhook processing with signature verification.

## M1 — Ledger core (detailed plan / status)

Turns the ledger from "records postings" into "maintains balances safely under concurrency."

**Balance convention:** a CREDIT increases an account's balance, a DEBIT decreases it
(`delta = credit ? +amount : -amount`); reject when `balance + delta < 0`. Consistent with the
V1 net-zero trigger — per-account deltas sum to zero, so money is conserved per transaction.

**Concurrency:** `LedgerService.post()` locks each balance row with `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`
(`AccountBalanceRepository.findByIdForUpdate`) in **ascending account-id order** (deterministic
lock ordering ⇒ no deadlocks), applies the signed delta, enforces non-negative, and commits
atomically with the postings. `@Version` remains a secondary guard.

**Delivered in M1:**
- `LedgerService.post()` balance maintenance (lock-ordered, non-negative, atomic).
- `InsufficientFundsException` (→ HTTP 422 in M2).
- `AccountService.createAccount()` (account + zero balance row).
- Tests: `LedgerServiceTest` (invariant, unit), `LedgerServiceIT` (transfer / insufficient-funds
  rollback), and `LedgerConcurrencyIT` — 100 parallel 1-unit debits on a wallet funded for 50 ⇒
  exactly 50 succeed, 50 `InsufficientFunds`, final balance 0, never negative.

**Deferred:** `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto` is held at `none` (not `validate`) for now to avoid a
`char(3)`/`varchar` column-type validation mismatch; flip it once entity↔column types are aligned
(small follow-up).

**Run the tests** (no host JDK needed — runs in the Gradle image with the Docker socket mounted):

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v "$PWD":/home/gradle/src -w /home/gradle/src \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -e TESTCONTAINERS_HOST_OVERRIDE=host.docker.internal \
  -e TESTCONTAINERS_RYUK_DISABLED=true \
  --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
  gradle:jdk21 gradle test --no-daemon
```

## M2 — Payments + idempotency (done, verified green)

Builds the payment layer on the M1 ledger primitive (`LedgerService.post`) — no ledger changes.

**Payment state machine:** CREATED → PROCESSING → SUCCEEDED | FAILED | FUNDS_LOCKED.

**Saga** (two ledger transactions, the PSP call between committed phases):
- HOLD — payer USER_WALLET → PSP_SUSPENSE (Tx1, payment PROCESSING)
- mock PSP `authorize()` — outside any DB transaction
- SETTLE — PSP_SUSPENSE → payee (Tx2 → SUCCEEDED), or REVERSE — PSP_SUSPENSE → payer (Tx2 → FAILED)

**Idempotency (DB-durable, Stripe-style):** unique `(merchant_id, idem_key)`; the first request
claims an IN_PROGRESS row, the rest conflict (409) or replay once COMPLETED. On operation failure
the claim is released so a genuine retry can re-attempt.

**Transaction boundaries:** claim + hold commit (Tx1) → PSP call → settle/reverse + finalize (Tx2).
`PaymentService` orchestrates (not `@Transactional`); `PaymentSaga` and `IdempotencyService` own the
short transactions.

**Delivered:**
- `Payment` / `PaymentStatus`, `IdempotencyRecord` / `IdempotencyStatus`, repositories
- `MockPspClient` behind a `PaymentProvider` interface
- `IdempotencyService`, `PaymentSaga`, `PaymentService`
- `PaymentController` (`POST /v1/payments`, `GET /v1/payments/{id}`), DTOs, `GlobalExceptionHandler`
  (→ 409 / 422 / 404 / 400 as RFC-7807 ProblemDetail)
- Tests: `PaymentServiceIT` (approved / insufficient-funds / replay / body-mismatch),
  `PaymentReversalIT` (declined → hold reversed, payer made whole),
  `PaymentServiceConcurrencyIT` (50 identical concurrent requests → exactly one payment, payer
  debited once), `PaymentControllerIT` (201 shape, `Idempotency-Key` required). All green.

**Deferred:** outbox → Kafka (M3) · webhooks (M4) · refunds + reconciliation (M5) · Redis
idempotency fast-path (optimization).

---

## M3 — Outbox + Kafka (done, verified green)

Reliable event publishing on top of M2's saga — no lost/phantom events, idempotent consumption.

**Outbox write:** `PaymentSaga.settle`/`reverse` writes a `payment.succeeded`/`payment.failed`
`OutboxEvent` in the **same transaction** as the state change (atomic — solves the dual-write
problem). Payload is JSON stored in the `outbox.payload` jsonb column (`@JdbcTypeCode(SqlTypes.JSON)`).

**Relay:** `OutboxRelay` (`@Scheduled`, `@Transactional`) selects unpublished rows with
`FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED LIMIT`, publishes via an `EventPublisher`, then stamps `published_at`.
Publishing is abstracted behind `EventPublisher` so the relay is testable without a broker;
`KafkaEventPublisher` blocks for the ack, so a failed send leaves the row to retry.

**Consumer:** `PaymentEventConsumer` (`@KafkaListener`) dedupes on `processed_events(event_id)` —
at-least-once delivery + dedup = effectively exactly-once.

**Profiles:** `SchedulingConfig` and `KafkaConfig` are `@Profile("!test")`; the `test` profile
disables listener auto-start. The embedded-Kafka e2e re-enables it.

**Delivered:**
- `V2__processed_events.sql`; `OutboxEvent` / `ProcessedEvent` + repos (`lockUnpublishedBatch`
  native `SKIP LOCKED`)
- `OutboxWriter`, `PaymentEvent` / `PaymentEventTypes`, wired into the saga
- `EventPublisher` / `KafkaEventPublisher`, `KafkaConfig` (topic), `OutboxRelay`,
  `PaymentEventConsumer`
- Tests (all green): `OutboxWriteIT` (atomic write), `OutboxRelayIT` (publish + mark via a recording
  publisher), `ConsumerIdempotencyIT` (duplicate → handled once),
  `PaymentEventsEndToEndIT` (`@EmbeddedKafka`: payment → outbox → relay → Kafka → consumer, once)

**Deferred:** Debezium CDC relay (replace polling) · schema registry / Avro · multi-instance relay
coordination beyond `SKIP LOCKED`.

## M4 — PSP webhooks / async capture (done, verified green)

Authorize now, capture or fail later via a signed, idempotent webhook.

**Authorization outcomes:** `authorize()` returns `CAPTURED` (settle now — M2's synchronous path),
`PENDING` (payment → `AUTHORIZED`, funds held, await webhook), or `DECLINED` (reverse). The mock PSP
returns `CAPTURED` by default, so M2 behavior is unchanged.

**Webhook:** `POST /v1/webhooks/psp` reads the raw body, verifies an HMAC-SHA256 signature
(`X-PSP-Signature`, constant-time compare) — missing/invalid → 401. Then it dedupes on
`webhook_events(psp_event_id)` and, if the referenced payment is `AUTHORIZED`, captures
(→ `settle` → SUCCEEDED + `payment.succeeded` outbox event) or fails (→ `reverse` → FAILED, payer
refunded).

**Idempotency (two guards):** the `psp_event_id` dedup **and** a state guard (only `AUTHORIZED` is
acted on) — redelivery captures once. Composes with M3: capture/fail run `settle`/`reverse`, which
write the outbox event.

**Delivered:**
- `AuthorizationOutcome` (CAPTURED/PENDING/DECLINED), `PaymentStatus.AUTHORIZED`,
  `PaymentSaga.authorizePending`
- `WebhookEvent` / `WebhookStatus` + repo; `PaymentRepository.findByPspReference`
- `WebhookSignatureVerifier` (HMAC, `psp.webhook.secret`), `PspWebhookEvent` / `PspWebhookTypes`
- `WebhookService`, `PspWebhookController`, `InvalidSignatureException` → 401
- Tests (all green): `WebhookCaptureIT` (capture → SUCCEEDED + payee credited + outbox event;
  fail → FAILED + refund; duplicate → captured once), `PspWebhookControllerIT` (200 valid sig,
  401 bad/missing sig)

**Deferred:** richer event types (refund.*, dispute.*) · JWS/JWKS key rotation vs a static HMAC
secret (done at CoinSwitch; optional hardening here).

## M5 — Refunds + reconciliation (done, verified green)

**Refunds:** `POST /v1/payments/{id}/refunds` (idempotent on `Idempotency-Key`) refunds a captured
payment — full → `REFUNDED`, partial → `PARTIALLY_REFUNDED` — via a `REFUND` ledger transaction
moving payee → payer, guarded by a running `refunded_amount` (over-refund → 422). Emits a
`payment.refunded` outbox event. `RefundService` mirrors `PaymentService` (idempotency
claim/replay); the transactional ledger move lives in `PaymentSaga.refund`.

**Reconciliation** (`@Scheduled`, `@Profile("!test")`, invoked directly in tests):
- **Ledger integrity** (`LedgerIntegrityChecker`): asserts `Σ(DEBIT − CREDIT) = 0` and that each
  account's materialized balance equals `Σ(CREDIT − DEBIT)` of its postings; mismatches are logged
  at error level (the M6 `ledger_imbalance` signal).
- **Stale-hold expiry:** `AUTHORIZED` payments older than `reconciliation.authorized-timeout`
  (default 30m) are reversed — funds returned to the payer, `payment.failed` emitted.
- Returns a `ReconciliationReport(ledgerNet, driftedAccounts, expiredHolds)`.

**Delivered:**
- `V3__refunds.sql` (refunds table + `payments.refunded_amount`); `Refund` / `RefundStatus` + repo;
  `PaymentStatus` += `PARTIALLY_REFUNDED` / `REFUNDED`; `PaymentEventTypes.REFUNDED`
- `RefundService` + `PaymentSaga.refund` + `RefundController` + DTOs + `RefundNotAllowedException` → 422
- `LedgerIntegrityChecker`, `ReconciliationService`, `ReconciliationReport`;
  `LedgerEntryRepository.signedNet` / `findDriftedAccounts`,
  `PaymentRepository.findByStatusAndUpdatedAtBefore`
- Tests (all green): `RefundServiceIT` (full / partial / over-refund→422 / idempotent),
  `RefundControllerIT` (201 / 422), `ReconciliationIT` (ledger net = 0, drift detection),
  `StaleHoldExpiryIT` (back-dated AUTHORIZED hold → expired → payer made whole)

**Deferred:** PSP-side refund (async refund webhook) · auto-repair of detected drift (M5 only
detects and alerts).
